/**
 * Streamer Wars - Player Isolation
 * Handles player isolation/quarantine logic
 */

// This module will contain player isolation logic extracted from the main file
// For now, it serves as a placeholder for the modular structure

// These functions will be extracted from the original streamer-wars.ts:
// - aislatePlayer
// - unaislatePlayer
// - isPlayerAislated
// - aislateMultiplePlayers
// - unaislateAllPlayers
