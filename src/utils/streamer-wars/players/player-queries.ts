/**
 * Streamer Wars - Player Queries
 * Query functions for player data
 */

// This module will contain player query logic extracted from the main file
// For now, it serves as a placeholder for the modular structure

// These functions will be extracted from the original streamer-wars.ts:
// - getExpulsionVotes
// - currentUserHasVoted
// - getNegativeVotes
// - getPlayersLiveOnTwitch
