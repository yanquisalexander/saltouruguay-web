/**
 * Streamer Wars - Player Operations
 * Core player management operations
 */

// This module will contain player operation logic extracted from the main file
// For now, it serves as a placeholder for the modular structure

// These functions will be extracted from the original streamer-wars.ts:
// - addPlayer
// - removePlayer
// - getPlayers
// - getUserIdsOfPlayers
// - getCurrentInscriptions
